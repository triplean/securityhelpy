# Security Helpy
Making Security Breach more casual player friendly

##### Note: Guides are still in progress.

###### Also, you can check the [java version](https://github.com/triplean/sh_java)!

## Prerequisites
- Windows 10 or later / Any linux distribution. *Doesn't work on your distro? Open a issue.*
- Flutter SDK installed in your system and available in your PATH

## Ensuring everything is good to go
To ensure you're ready to either compile or run the code from the source, run the following command:
```
flutter doctor
```
You should see a list of requisites for compiling to different devices, so ensure you have everything in green for your desired device.
For example: If I want to compile or run in a android VM I should check that everything related to android is OK.

## Running üöÄ
Running SecurityHelpy is as simple as running:
```
flutter run
```
Now, select your desired device, and just wait for the app to compile and run, a window should open.

## Building the binaries üõ†Ô∏è
***Note: All of the following commands needs to be run on the source directory.***

For compiling, we need to select the target.
The most common targets are:
- APK
- Your local binary (.exe for windows or a executable file in Linux)
- APP (for macros)

## FAQ
**Can I contribute with the guides?**
I'm currently working on it. With the release of 2.0 i will create a tool for contributing wit guides.

**Is Mac/Iphone supported?**
I don't plan on adding any kind of support to Mac or Iphone. You can compile by yourself the app, but **I will not attend issues that occur on Mac/Iphone.**
